# TestOfSkills
A Web App to test one's skill for a STEM Expo Project

# Idea
- Make a web application that has many different tests that test the skills of somebody
- Collect data on these tests and show a graph using d3.js and show it to the people
- Compile the data and application and present it to the STEM expo

# Skills
- Test of Tenacity (reaction speed)
- Test of Swiftness (aim trainer)
- Test of Order (number memory)
- Test of Linguistics (word memory)

# New Plan
- Use p5 for all of the tests
- Order and Linguistics might not be implemented, i will have to see
- No radixui or tailwind for the tests (rip)
- This is because it will take much longer to make the tests
- Pros: logic will be much easier to implement
- Cons: styling will be a pain

# Final Plan
- Only have the 4 main tests
- No Discipline, Force, or Control
- This is because it was not worth to make them for the STEM Expo
- Turned out really well in the end
- Added data collection, results.json, and code comments
- Project Finished
